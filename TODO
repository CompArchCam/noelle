- Extract all DSWP heuristics from the pass "DSWP" to the pass "heuristics"

- Extend the autotuner to parallelize multiple loops

- Extend the autotuner to decide #threads per loop

- Modify DSWP to be able to parallelize multiple loops at the same time

- Optimization: inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Optimization: implement PS-DSWP

- Optimization: create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences

- Optimization: extend the PDG analysis to tag explicitly loop-carried data dependences. Extend the SCC analysis accordingly
