- Print internal nodes of an SCC (the print method of the class SCC) following their dependences

- add the normalization from do-while to while loops

- fix bugs highlighted by the current tests

- add tests related to control flows

- test DSWP on real workloads using the autotuning exploration

- Optimization 1: push and pop within sub-loops only once per iteration

- Optimization 2: prune the CFG of the generated functions as much as we can

- Optimization 3: exploit induction variables to avoid unnecessary synchronizations

- Optimization 4: packing/unpacking pushes and pops
