- Add multiple levels of verbosity

- Extract mergeSCC from partitionSCCDAG

- Create a new abstraction for partitions

- Modify DSWP to be able to parallelize multiple loops at the same time

- Optimization: inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Optimization: implement PS-DSWP

- Optimization: create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences
