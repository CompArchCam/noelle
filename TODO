- Print internal nodes of an SCC (the print method of the class SCC) following their dependences

- Stop DSWP when there is only one partition of the SCCDAG

- Make "collectStageAndQueueInfo" returning void (abort inside when something goes wrong).

- Optimization: inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Optimization: inline calls to queues as much as possible

- Optimization: implement the lock-free version of ThreadSafeSpinLockQueue

- Optimization: implement PS-DSWP
