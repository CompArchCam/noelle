==== SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Add the option to decide the number of threads to target per loop

- Reconsider all abstractions (e.g., do we need all LoopSummary, LoopInfoSummary, and LoopDependenceInfo? do we need SCCEdgeInfo?)

- Create a "Dependence" abstraction, which is DG<Value>
  - have methods like "getSource(), getDestination(), isMemoryBased()"

==== AUTOTUNER
- Extend the autotuner to decide #threads per loop

- Extend the autotuner to decide the parallelization-specific parameters (e.g., chunk size for DOALL, SCCDAG partitioning for DSWP)


==== Parallelizer
- Modify parallelizer to be able to parallelize multiple loops nested to each other at the same time


==== DOALL
- Promote chunk size to be an option (e.g., --doall-chunksize)


==== OTHER PARALLELIZATION SCHEMES
- Implement PS-DSWP

- Implement HELIX


==== OPTIMIZATIONS
- Inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences


Task log - Angelo
  - investigate failure to parallelize streamcluster doall loops / RedIters2
  - investigate failure of load-store backedge removal heuristic
  - do not inline calls to the function inlining within
  - min-max partition heuristic
  - extract environment construction from DSWP and DOALL
  - clean up analysis classes (SCCDAGAttrs, SimpleIVInfo, ...)
  - write performance tests (~40 secs baseline length, use time, awk, measure speedup: base/par)
