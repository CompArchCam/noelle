- Add the new class information SCCInformation
  - It includes a pointer to the SCC that it refers to
  
- Add the following attributes to both SCCInformation and SCCDAGPartition:
  - Does it contain a loop?
  - Does it contain a loop-carried data dependence (i.e., is it an actual SCC?)?
  - SCC cost = the computation cost of that SCC

- Extend the autotuner to parallelize multiple loops

- Extend the autotuner to decide #threads per loop

- Bug fix: IndipendentIterations has an extra stage due to induction variables that shouldn't exist

- Bug fix: partitioning heuristics doesn't terminate

- Add multiple levels of verbosity

- Modify DSWP to be able to parallelize multiple loops at the same time

- Optimization: inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Optimization: implement PS-DSWP

- Optimization: create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences
