Simplifcations:
1) there is only one function in the whole program
2) there is only one loop in the whole program
3) you know at compile time how many iterations of the loop you will have at run time
4) there are < 1000 number of iterations
5) you know that there are only 2 SCC
6) you know you have only one variable across SCCs
7) no dependences from outside instructions to inside the loop
8) there is no memory data dependences
