- Bug fix: create a test for loop 19 of streamcluster and fix its bug (the heuristic of partitioning the SCCDAG doesn't converge)

- Add the option to decide the number of threads to target

- Reconsider all abstractions (e.g., do we need both SCC and SCCInfo? do we need both SCCDAG and SCCDAGInfo?)

- Add the doall and ps-dswp passes

- Extend the autotuner to decide #threads per loop

- Extend the autotuner to decide the parallelization-specific parameters (e.g., chunk size for DOALL, SCCDAG partitioning for DSWP)

- Modify DSWP to be able to parallelize multiple loops nested to each other at the same time

- Optimization: implement DOALL

- Optimization: implement PS-DSWP

- Optimization: inline calls involved in an SCC and rerun the PDG analysis

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Optimization: create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences
