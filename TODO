==== SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
- Reconsider all abstractions (e.g., do we need all LoopSummary, LoopInfoSummary, and LoopDependenceInfo? do we need SCCEdgeInfo?)

- Create a "Dependence" abstraction, which is DG<Value>
  - have methods like "getSource(), getDestination(), isMemoryBased()"

==== Renaming
generateStagesFromPartitionedSCCs -> generatePipelineStagesFromPartitionedSCCDAG


==== Parallelizer
- Modify parallelizer to be able to parallelize multiple loops nested to each other at the same time


==== OTHER PARALLELIZATION SCHEMES
- Implement PS-DSWP

- Implement HELIX


==== BENCHMARKS
- Bring all PARSEC benchmarks


==== OPTIMIZATIONS
- Packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Create a new pass to map memory locations to variables as much as possible
  This removes the overly conservative memory loop-carried data dependences


Task log - Angelo
  - clean up analysis classes (SCCDAGAttrs, SimpleIVInfo, ...)
  PropagateLiveOuts -> GenerateCodeToLoadLiveOutVars
  PopulateEnvironment -> GenerateCodeTOCreateEnvironment
