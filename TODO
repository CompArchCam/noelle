- Print internal nodes of an SCC (the print method of the class SCC) following their dependences

- test DSWP on real workloads using the autotuning exploration

- Optimization: prune the CFG of the generated functions as much as we can

- Optimization: packing/unpacking pushes and pops

- Option 1: always parallelize even when #SCCs = 1

- Option 2: do not merge SCCs
