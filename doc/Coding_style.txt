Next is what we would like to do or avoid in our codebase:

- No function body in the headers

- No use of integer built-in data types (e.g., int, long int), but use the ones that make the bitwidth explicit (e.g., uint32_t, int32_t)

- The scopes of control structures must be within {}.
  For example, no 
    while (condition) f();
  instead, write
    while (condition) {
      f();
    }

  Also, no
    if (condition) something();
  instead, write
    if (condition) {
      something();
    }

- Always create and name temporary variables.
  Avoid coding like 
    myF(myG())

  Instead, create a temporary variable and name it to help the reader understanding the meaning of that value.
  Something like:
    auto loopToParallelize = myG();
    myF(loopToParallelize)

- Name your variables in the most meaningful way.
  Variable names are used to read and understand the code. Take advantage of it to make enjoyable reading your code.

- Make inputs of a function as explicit as possible. 
  Implicit inputs (e.g., object fields) makes often the code harder to understand.
