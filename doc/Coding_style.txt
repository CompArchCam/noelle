Next is what we would like to do or avoid in our codebase:
- No function body in the headers

- No use of integer builtin data types (e.g., int, long int), but use the ones that make the bitwidth explicit (e.g., uint32_t, int32_t)

- The scopes of control structures must be within {}.
  For example, no 
    while (condition) f();
  instead, write
    while (condition) {
      f();
    }

  Also, no
    if (condition) something();
  instead, write
    if (condition) {
      something();
    }
